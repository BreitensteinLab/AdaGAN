# AdaGAN: Boosting Generative Models

This project implements the AdaGAN algorithm, presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02386).

## Getting started

It is assumed that the user runs TensorFlow of version > 12.

Put all the sources in one directory and make sure the directory also contains sub-directories called *mnist* and *models*
containing MNIST datasets and the pre-trained models respectively.

## Running

```
python adagan_icml.py [options]
```
